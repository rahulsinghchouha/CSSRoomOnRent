To increase the size of a card and change its z-index on hover using Tailwind CSS, you can use the hover: prefix to apply styles when the card is hovered over. Hereâ€™s an example of how you can achieve this:

HTML Structure: Make sure your card has a class that you can target with Tailwind CSS.

Tailwind CSS: Use the transform, scale-105, and z-10 classes to increase the size and z-index on hover.

Here's an example of how you can do it:

html
Copy code
<div class="relative">
  <div class="card bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg transform transition-transform duration-300 hover:scale-105 hover:z-10">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Card Title</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Card content goes here...</p>
  </div>
</div>
Explanation:
relative: This ensures that the card can have a higher z-index relative to its parent.
card: Custom class name for your card, which can be styled further as needed.
bg-white: Background color of the card.
p-6: Padding inside the card.
rounded-lg: Rounded corners of the card.
shadow-lg: Large shadow for the card.
transform transition-transform duration-300: Enables smooth transition for transform properties over 300ms.
hover:scale-105: Scales the card to 105% of its original size on hover.
hover:z-10: Increases the z-index to 10 on hover to bring the card to the front.
Feel free to adjust the padding, scaling factor, and z-index value as per your design requirements.
